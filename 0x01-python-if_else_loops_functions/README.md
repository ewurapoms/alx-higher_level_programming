# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project highlights the use of conditional statements and loops in Python by using `if`,
`if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range` statements with `while` and
`for` loops. There are 17 total tasks to solve and practise with after studying the extensive resources
provided on the subject.
